## Problem 56 - Powerful Digit Sum

A googol (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=10^{100}">) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros;

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=100^{100}"> is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros.

Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.

Considering natural numbers of the form, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a^b">, where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a, b < 100">, what is the maximum digital sum?
